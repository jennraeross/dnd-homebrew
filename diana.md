### Bonus Proficiencies
When you adopt this Divine Domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons that have the *ranged* or *thrown* property.

### Fighting Style
At 1st level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. 

You canâ€™t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### Archery
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

#### Thrown Weapon Fighting
You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.

In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.

### Channel Divinity: *Hunting Companion*
At 2nd level you gain this additional Channel Divinity option. As an action, cast the *Find Familiar* spell, without material components. When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar must take the form of either a hawk or a mastiff, and it disappears after a number of hours equal to half your cleric level (rounded up).

### Hindering Shot
Starting at 6th level, your accuracy is sufficient to target crippling areas of the body. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can choose to apply one of the following options:

- The target's movement speed is halved until the beginning of your next turn.
- Checks to maintain concentration as a result of this attack are made at disadvantage.

### Divine Strike
At 8th level you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 magical piercing damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
