### Healer's Providence

_1st-level Vesta feature_

You are under the effect of _Sanctuary_. If you attack, cast a spell that effects an enemy, or deal damage, this effect is suppressed until the beginning of your next turn.

### Virtue of Patience

_1st-level Vesta feature_

When you cast a spell that restores a creature's hitpoints or removes a negative condition with a casting time of 1 action, you may choose to instead cast it with a casting time of 10 minutes. If you do so, you may target one additional creature with the casting.

### Channel Divinity: _Heart's Fire_

_2nd-level Vesta feature_

You gain this additional Channel Divinity option. Invoking the power of the Hearth, you kindle a cheery fire, which lasts 8 hours, in an available space within 30 feet. Any creature who spends at least 10 minutes within 5 feet of the fire gains temporary hit points equal to your wisdom modifier. Furthermore, any creature who spends a short rest within 20 feet of the fire and expends hit dice to recover their health can treat the lowest roll of their hit dice as if it had rolled it's maximum value. Long rests spent within 5 feet of the fire reduce a creature's exhaustion by one extra level.

### Charitable Healing

_6th-level Vesta feature_

When casting a spell that restores a creature's hitpoints or removes a negative condition with a material component that has a specified cost, you may reduce the cost of the component by 25gp for every level you have in this class. If this would reduce the cost to 0gp, you may treat the spell as if it has no material component. Once you use this ability, it may not be used again until you complete a long rest.

### Potent Spellcasting

_8th-level Vesta feature_

You add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

### Protection of the Hearth

_17th-level Vesta feature_

At 17th level, add the spells _Heroes' Feast, Temple of the Gods, Holy Aura,_ and _Mass Heal_ to your list of Domain Spells. Like your other Domain Spells, they are always prepared.
