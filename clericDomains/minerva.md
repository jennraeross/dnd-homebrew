### Bonus Proficiencies

_1st-level Minerva feature_

You gain proficiency with weavers tools, potters tools, martial weapons and heavy armor.

### Master of Crafts

_1st-level Minerva feature_

Whenever you finish a long rest, you may create a piece of craftsmanship and imbue it with divine power, turning it into a magic item, from the items detailed below. If the item has a level requirement, it can only be created if you have a cleric level equal or greater than the requirement. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you imbue the item. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement. You may attune to any item created with this feature, regardless of race or class restrictions.

Said item remains indefinitely, but if you die, the divine power within fades, leaving it a normal item with no magical properties.

You can only have one item created in this manner at a time. If you attempt to create an item while another item created by this feature exists, the enchantment on the other item ends, rendering it a normal item without any inherent magical properties.

| Cleric Level | Items Replicable |
| :----------- | :--------------- |
| 1st          | Bag of Bounty, Pot of Awakening, Glamerweave    |
| 6th          | Alchemy Jug, Bag of Holding, Cloak of Elvenkind |
| 14th         | Cloak of Protection, Mantle of Spell Resistance, Carpet of Flying |

### Channel Divinity: _Focus Fire_

_2nd-level Minerva feature_

You gain this additional Channel Divinity option. As a bonus action, you point at a creature within 60ft of you and force them to make a Dexterity saving throw. If they fail, they are wreathed in golden light until the end of your next turn. Any attack roll against the affected creature has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature can't benefit from being invisible.

### Press the Advantage

### Divine Strike

_8th-level Minerva feature_

You gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Fortune Favors the Prepared

_17th-level Minerva feature_

At 17th level, when you must make a saving throw, you may gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum bonus of +1). You may use this ability a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier and regain all uses on a long rest.
