You gain the _Guidance_ cantrip, if you don't already know it.

### Channel Divinity: _Forewarning_

You gain this additional Channel Divinity option. Due to your knowledge of prophecy, you are able to forewarn others and prepare them for danger. As a reaction, when an ally would be reduced to 0 hitpoints, you may use your Channel Divinity to cause them to be reduced to 1 hitpoint instead.

### Medical Training

### Seership
