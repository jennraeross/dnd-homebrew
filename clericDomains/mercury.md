### Godspeed

_1st-level Mercury Feature_

When you take this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency in Acrobatics and thieves tools.

Additionally, you can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have a light melee weapon in both hands. 

### Good Fortune

_1st-level Mercury feature_

When you fail a saving throw or ability check, you may roll a d4 and add it to the total, possibly changing the outcome. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all uses on a long rest.

### Channel Divinity: _Escape Route_

_2nd-level Mercury feature_

You gain this additional Channel Divinity option. As a bonus action, you can verbally call upon divine power to escape your enemies. When you do so, you can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see.

### Swift Reflexes

_6th-level Mercury feature_

When you cast a cantrip with a casting time of one action or make a weapon attack, you can take the Disengage or Dodge action as a bonus action.

Additionally, when you make a weapon attack with a light melee weapon you are holding in one hand, you can also make an attack with a different light melee weapon you are holding in your other hand. You do not add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

### Divine Strike

_8th-level Mercury feature_

You gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Luck of the Gods

_17th-level Mercury feature_

Add _Foresight_ to your list of domain spells. Like your other domain spells, it is always prepared and counts as a cleric spell for you.

Additionally, you now regain uses of your _Good Fortune_ feature on a short or long rest.
