### Bonus Cantrip

_1st-level Bacchus feature_

You gain the _Friends_ cantrip if you don't already know it. For you, this cantrip counts as a cleric cantrip.

### Drunken Functionality

_1st-level Bacchus feature_

Clerics of Bacchus have resistance to poison and advantage on saves against the poisoned condition. Furthermore, exhaustion no longer gives you disadvantage on ability checks.

### Channel Divinity: _Festive Madness_

_2nd-level Bacchus feature_

You gain this additional Channel Divinity option. As an action, you may cause a number of creatures up to your Wisdom modifier within 60 ft of you to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, a creature targeted has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls. They may repeat the save at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success.

### Life of the Party

_6th-level Bacchus feature_

At 6th level, your extensive exposure to festivities has given you a particular way with people. Whenever you make a Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Performance) check, you may use your Wisdom modifier instead.

Additionally, you gain proficiency in Persuasion and Performance, if you do not already have them, and expertise in them while you have at least one level of exhaustion due to alcohol.

### Potent Spellcasting

_8th-level Bacchus feature_

You add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

### Avatar of Drunkenness

_17th-level Bacchus feature_

You are no longer subject to any of the effects of the poisoned condition, or the negative effects of exhaustion caused by poison or alcohol. As long as you have at least one level of exhaustion due to alcohol, you may add half your proficiency bonus to all ability checks with which you do not already have proficiency.

You may cast the spell _Glibness_ without using a spell slot. When cast this way, instead of a verbal component, the spell uses the material component of a bottle of wine worth at least 5gp, which the spell consumes. You may not cast this way again until you complete a long rest.
