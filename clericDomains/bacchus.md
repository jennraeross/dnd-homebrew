### Bonus Cantrip

_1st-level Bacchus feature_

You gain the _Friends_ cantrip if you don't already know it. For you, this cantrip counts as a cleric cantrip.

### Drunken Functionality

_1st-level Bacchus feature_

Clerics of Bacchus have resistance to poison and advantage on saves against the poisoned condition. Furthermore, exhaustion no longer gives you disadvantage on ability checks.

### Channel Divinity: _Festive Madness_

_2nd-level Bacchus feature_

You gain this additional Channel Divinity option. As an action, you may cause a number of creatures up to your Wisdom modifier within 60 ft of you to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, a creature targeted has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls. They may repeat the save at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success.

### Life of the Party

_6th-level Bacchus feature_

At 6th level, your extensive exposure to festivities has given you a particular way with people. Whenever you make a Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Deception) check, you may use your Wisdom modifier instead.

Additionally, you gain proficiency in Charisma saving throws, and one of either Persuasion or Deception, if you do not already have it.

### Potent Spellcasting

_8th-level Bacchus feature_

You add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.
