### Bonus Proficiencies
_1st-level Diana feature_

When you adopt this Divine Domain, you gain proficiency with martial weapons that have the _ranged_ or _thrown_ property.

### Fighting Style

_1st-level Diana feature_

You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options.

You canâ€™t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### Archery

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

#### Thrown Weapon Fighting

You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.

In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.

### Channel Divinity: _Hunting Companion_

_2nd-level Diana feature_

You gain this additional Channel Divinity option. As an action, you summon a wild spirit in the form of a wolf. It is friendly to you and your companions, and obeys your commands. See the creature's game statistics in the Lycan Spirit stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. In combat, the Wolf shares your initiative count, but takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use reactions on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the Wolf can take any action of its choice. If the Wolf is reduced to zero hitpoints, it vanishes back to whence it came. The wolf also vanishes after a number of hours equal to half your cleric level (rounded up).

### Hindering Shot

_6th-level Diana feature_

Your accuracy is sufficient to target crippling areas of the body. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can choose to apply one of the following options:

- The target's movement speed is halved until the beginning of your next turn.
- Checks to maintain concentration as a result of this attack are made at disadvantage.

### Divine Strike

_8th-level Diana feature_

You gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 magical piercing damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Hunting Tactics

_17th-level Diana feature_

You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature if a creature summoned by either your Channel Divinity: _Hunting Companion_ feature or the _Summon Beast_ spell is within five feet of it and is not _incapacitated_.
