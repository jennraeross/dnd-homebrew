### Bonus Proficiencies

_1st-level Pretraia feature_

When you adopt this Divine Domain, you learn to speak, read, and write Celestial and Infernal.

### Scorching Light

_1st-level Pretraia feature_

You gain the _Firebolt_ and _Light_ cantrips, if you don't already know them. For you, they count as cleric cantrips.

Additionally, when you cast a cleric cantrip or spell which deals fire damage, you may choose to deal radiant damage instead. This feature may be used on spells of 1st-level or higher a number of times equal to your wisdom modifier, and on cantrips an unlimited number of times. You regain all uses upon completion of a long rest.

### Channel Divinity: _Pierce the Darkness_

_2nd-level Pretraia feature_

At 2nd level, you gain this additional Channel Divinity option. As an action, you emanate bright light for 60ft. This light overcomes magical darkness created by spells cast at up to 3rd level. Creatures within this light cannot benefit from invisibility, and illusions within the light will be automatically detected.

### Burn the Wicked

_6th-level Pretraia feature_

At 6th level, your devotion towards the destruction of evil augments your spells. When rolling damage from one of your cleric spells against a creature with an evil alignment, you may reroll any 1's or 2's.

Additionally, you sense when there is a creature within 60ft of you with an evil alignment.

### Potent Spellcasting

_8th-level Pretraia feature_

Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

### All Will Come to Light

_17th-level Pretraia feature_

At 17th level, the light of Pretraia's Lantern reveals all to your eyes. You benefit from _Truesight_.
