### Elemental Fury
_1st-level Genius Locus feature_

When you deal force or necrotic damage, you can choose to deal fire, cold, or lightning damage instead.

Additionally, whenever you learn a warlock cantrip, you can choose it from the warlock spell list, or from the following spells: _Control Flames, Gust, Mold Earth, Shape Water_. These cantrips are warlock cantrips for you.

### Natural Rites
_6th-level Genius Locus feature_

At the end of a long rest, you can prepare a number of spells from the Druid spell list that have the ritual tag equal to your proficiency bonus. You can't cast these spells except as rituals. This feature does not give you the ability to cast warlock spells with the ritual tag as rituals.

### Master the Elements
_10th-level Genius Locus feature_

You learn two of the cantrips granted by _Elemental Fury_. If you already know more than two of those cantrips you can choose cantrips from the warlock spell list instead.

### Earthly Aid
_14th-level Genius Locus feature_

Your friendship with the spirits of the land has grown to the point that they will directly give you aid. Once per long rest, you may cast _Druid Grove, Transport via Plants,_ or _Wall of Thorns_.
