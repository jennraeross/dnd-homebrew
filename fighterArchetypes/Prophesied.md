### Divine Presence

_3rd-level Prophesied feature_

You have been favored of the gods, and it shows in your presence and abilities. When you adopt this archetype, you gain the ability to cast the _Thaumaturgy_ and _Sacred Flame_ cantrips, without material components. Charisma is your spellcasting modifier for these cantrips. You also gain proficiency in Charisma (Persuasion) checks.

### Touched by the Gods

_3rd-level Prophesied feature_

One of the Deities of your Plane has taken a particular interest in you. Choose a Cleric Domain associated with the aforementioned Deity. You gain the 2nd level Channel Divinity ability associated with that Domain and can use it once per short or long rest.

### Armor of Fate

_7th-level Prophesied feature_

By this point, you have become ensnared in the threads of Fate, and they are loathe to release you from your destiny. You can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any saving throw you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.

### Legendary Weapon

_10th-level Prophesied feature_

Any weapon you wield is wrapped in your legend. While wielding a weapon, it becomes a magical weapon, if it was not magical already, and deals and additional 1d8 of damage, of the same type as is dealt by the 8th level Divine Strike of the Domain chosen in your _Touched by the Gods_ feature. If that domain does not have a Divine Strike feature, the damage type is Radiant.

### Improved Armor of Fate

_15th-level Prophesied feature_

When you use the Channel Divinity provided by your _Touched by the Gods_ feature, you also regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.

### Divine Intervention

_18th-level Prophesied feature_

You can call on your deity to intervene on your behalf when your need is great.

Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.

If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.
