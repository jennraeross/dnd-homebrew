### Bonus Proficiencies
At 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons and heavy armor.

### Trained for War
Having been trained in the arts of war, you understand that more important than strength is how you use it. At 1st level, when you attack with a weapon you are proficient with, you can use your Wisdom modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your cleric level, and regain all uses upon the completion of a short or long rest.

### Channel Divinity: *Strategic Insight*
At 2nd level, you gain this additional Channel Divinity option. You call upon divine aid (no action required), and are given understanding of how to turn your situation to your benefit. Your next weapon attack this turn is made with advantage.

### Press the Advantage
Upon reaching 6th level, when you make a weapon attack with advantage, if it hits you may add your Wisdom modifier (minimum bonus of +1) to the damage roll.

### Divine Strike
At 8th level you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Fortune Favors the Prepared
At 17th level, when you must make a saving throw, you may gain a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum bonus of +1). You may use this ability a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier and regain all uses on a long rest.
