### Bonus Proficiencies

_2nd-level Pack feature_

You gain proficiency in Simple Weapons, as well as the Nature skill, and Poisoner's Kits.

### Wild Retaliation

_2nd-level Pack Feature_

You gain a pool of d8's equal to your proficiency bonus.

When you roll damage for a weapon attack, you may augment that damage by spending dice from the pool. Roll the spent dice and add them to your damage as acid damage.

Additionally, as a bonus action, you may spend dice from the pool to heal yourself. Roll the dice and regain a number of hitpoints equal to the roll.

You regain all spent dice upon completion of a short or long rest.

> Note:
> Many wildshape forms are capable of weapon attacks.

### Companion Spirit

_6th-level Pack feature_

You gain the ability to cast _Summon Beast_ without material components. When cast this way, the spell does not require you to maintain concentration. Additionally, when cast this way, issuing commands to the creature requires a bonus action. You can only have one creature summoned this way at a time.

### Enhanced Weaponry

_6th-level Pack feature_

Weapon attacks made by you or your _Companion Spirit_ count as magical for purposes of overcoming resistance or immunity.

### Pack Instincts

_10th-level Pack feature_

You have advantage on a weapon attack roll against a creature if your _Companion Spirit_ is within 5 feet of the creature and isn't incapacitated.

### Hunting Party

_14th-level Pack feature_

Once per long rest, when you use your wildshape feature, you may cause a number of willing creatures within 20 feet of you equal to your Wisdom modifier to assume the shape of the same beast. They can stay in this form for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down), or until they fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die. A target's game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak or cast spells. The target's gear melds into the new form. The target can't activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment. 

Additionally, you have advantage on a weapon attack roll against a creature if an ally affected by this feature is within 5 feet of the creature and isn't incapacitated.
