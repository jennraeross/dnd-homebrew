### Practiced Rites

_2nd-level Circle of Tradition feature_

Having spent years being trained in ritual magic, you know it by heart. You can cast any spell you know with the ritual tag as a ritual, even when you don't have it prepared. Furthermore, if you find a ritual spell for which you have an appropriate spell slot to cast written down, such as in a tome, scroll, or wizard's spellbook, you may add that spell to your list of known spells. This process consumes the written spell.

### Hastened Ritual

_6th-level Circle of Tradition feature_

You may cast a spell with the ritual tag from your known spells without expending a spell slot, using its normal casting time. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier and regain all uses upon completion of a long rest.

### Improvised Ritual

_10th-level Circle of Tradition feature_

Once per short rest, you may cast a spell you know of 4th level or lower which does not have the ritual tag as if it were a ritual, adding 10 minutes to the casting time, but not consuming a spell slot.
