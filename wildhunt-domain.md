## Wildhunt Domain v2

The Hunt is a concept that has existed since the dawn of life, before the rise of sentient races, before the practice of worship began. Those who seek to honor this path do so not through ritual and rites, but through the acceptance of their primal selves.

Clerics of the Wildhunt thrill in contests of strength and wit, and seek opportunity to prove themselves in competition with others. The most extreme of such have been known to throw themselves into danger, rejoicing in lethal combat, as the moments they feel most alive are those when said life is on the line.

### Fighting Style

At 1st level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options.

You canâ€™t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### Archery

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

#### Thrown Weapon Fighting

You can draw a weapon that has the thrown property as part of the attack you make with the weapon.

In addition, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll.

### Channel Divinity: _Hunting Companion_

At 2nd level you gain this additional Channel Divinity option. As an action, cast the _Find Familiar_ spell, without material components. When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar must take the form of either a hawk or a mastiff, and it disappears after a number of hours equal to half your cleric level (rounded up).

### Unnerving Arrows

Starting at 6th level, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can force it to make a wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it cannot willingly move closer to you until the beginning of your next turn.

### Divine Strike

Starting at 8th level, you learn to imbue your weapon's strikes with the power of the Hunt. Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to do an extra 1d8 psychic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Improved Unnatural Accuracy

At 17th level, when you make an attack with a weapon that has the _ranged_ or _thrown_ property, treat a roll of 19 or higher as a critical hit.
