### Bonus Proficiencies
When you adopt this Divine Domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor, martial weapons, and smiths tools.

### Bonus Cantrips
Also at 1st level, you gain the *Green Flame Blade* and *Mending* cantrips if you don't already know them. For you, these cantrips counts as cleric cantrips.

### Channel Divinity: *Forge of Creation*
At 2nd level, you gain this additional Channel Divinity option. As a bonus action, a weapon or tool with which you have proficiency forms in your hand. On subsequent turns, you may use your bonus action to change the form of the weapon or tool so long as it is in your hand. The created object disappears after a number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus.

### Master of Enchantment
At 6th level, weapons created with your Channel Divinity: *Forge of Creation* are magical and get +1 to attack rolls and damage. At 11th level this rises to +2, and at 17th it becomes +3.

### Divine Strike
At 8th level you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 fire damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Avatar of Flame
Upon reaching 17th level, your cleric spells and Divine Strike ignore resistance to fire damage.
